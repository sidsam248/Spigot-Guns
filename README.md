# Custom Guns Plugin

## Overview

This Spigot plugin adds craftable firearms, including pistols, rifles, and snipers, to your Minecraft server using Spigot 1.21. The plugin is fully integrated with the [LOROT's Armory Pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/lorot-s-armory-pack/) texture pack, ensuring visually appealing and realistic weapon designs. These custom weapons enhance both survival and PvP gameplay with unique mechanics, crafting recipes, and features.

## Features

- **Craftable Firearms**: Players can craft three types of guns:
  - **Pistols**: Crafted with iron blocks arranged in the top and left borders with a stick in the middle (resembles a trigger).
  - **Rifles**: Crafted using diamond blocks.
  - **Snipers**: Crafted using emerald blocks.

- **Custom Texture Pack Integration**: The plugin is designed to work seamlessly with LOROT's Armory Pack, giving each weapon a unique and visually appealing appearance.

- **Balanced Crafting Recipes**: Each weapon has a custom recipe that balances the rarity and power of the guns.

- **Weapon Mechanics**:
  - **Pistols**: Have a small cooldown between each shot to simulate realistic firing rates.
  - **Rifles**: Provide rapid-fire capabilities but have limited durability.
  - **Snipers**: Feature a zoom function that can be activated by left-clicking, with two levels of zoom for better precision.

- **Durability System**: Guns have a limited number of uses before they break, encouraging players to manage resources and craft new weapons when needed.
